# Floppy-Bird-Unity

This is the source code for floppy bird.

Script files can be found in the Assets directory.

This game was my introduction to Unity, C# and object oriented programming. So while it doesn't reinvent the wheel, I'm just happy it works.

The biggest takeaway from this project for me was the importance of making my code easily modifiable and reusable. For example, it's a lot easier to test the rate of pipes spawning by changing a single variable 
(that shows up on Unity's GUI nonetheless!) than it is to go hunting for a fixed integer in my code.
