# Floppy-Bird-Unity

This is the source code for floppy bird.

Script files can be found in the Assets directory.

This game was my introduction to Unity, C# and object oriented programming. So while it doesn't reinvent the wheel, I'm just happy it works.

The biggest takeaway from this project for me was the importance of making my code easily modifiable and reusable. For example, it's a lot easier to test the rate of pipes spawning by changing a single variable 
(that shows up on Unity's GUI nonetheless!) than it is to go hunting for a fixed integer in my code.

This is the tutorial I followed: https://youtu.be/XtQMytORBmM?si=q2Kz5-Hu6VNJNz7b

I chose it because it focuses on teaching you the basics more so than completing a project. In fact, the game isn't finished at the end of the tutorial. The youtuber encourages you to add a list of features on your
own at the end of the video to finish and refine the game (you can check said video's last section: "Next steps"), which I did.
